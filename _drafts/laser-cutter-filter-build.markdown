title: "Laser Cutter Filter Build"
---
Laser cutting involves generating potentially unhealty exhaust based on the type of materials being cut. Because of
this it is best to do filtration on the exhaust, even if venting to an exterior vent. There are many commercial
solutions available, but are often priced out of the reach of makerspaces, especially new, low budget and non-profit
spaces, such as MakerHQ.

We set out to build a system we felt was providing a fairly high level of filtration, but this device has not been
certified by any formal organization, so if you choose to build one for your machine, do so at your own risk! We make
no claim as to what level of filtration or safety standards are being met with this design.
