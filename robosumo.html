                    <h3>MakerHQ is hosting a Robosumo Mini competition!</h3>
                    <h4 style="color:black">Saturday, September 10, 2016 from 11:00 AM to 5:00 PM</h4>


                    <h3 style="color:red;text-decoration:underline"><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/sacramento-robosumo-2016-tickets-26143317366">If you want to compete, click here to sign up or learn more!</a></h3>

                    <p>Join us for this Second Saturday competition where you'll see who has designed the best autonomous Mini sumo robot.</p>

                    <p>This competition is meant for both those who are new to robotics and those experienced folks who want to show off what they've been working on. We will have prizes not only for first place, but also most creative robot, most decorated, and more!!</p>

                    <h3>Workshops</h3>
                    <p>We are offering TWO workshops (free to members, fee for non-members) on <a href="https://ti.to/makerhq/robosumo-workshop-session-1">August 25th</a> and <a href="https://ti.to/makerhq/robosumo-workshop-session-2">September 1st</a> that are focused on building robots and learning about sumo robot builds.</p>

<p>In addition to the build workshops, there will be a free trial run/practice session event on the evening of September 8th. This is your opportunity to do final testing before the competition on Saturday! </p>
                    <p>Interested in learning how to make sumo bots? Check out our workshops offered in the weeks coming up to Robosumo 2016 on our meetup! We will also be selling kits for those looking to purchase a Sumobot Jr setup.</p>
                    <h3>The Rules:</h3>

                    <p>We'll be following the <a href="http://robogames.net/rules/all-sumo.php">Unified Sumo Robot Rules</a>, specifically for the Mini sized competition. That means the following limitations on robots apply:</p>

                    <p>• Width: No more than 10cm</p>

                    <p>• Height: Unlimited</p>

                    <p>• Length: No more than 10cm</p>

                    <p>• Weight: No heavier than 500g</p>

                    <p>For an idea of how a Robo Sumo match works under these rules, refer to the official rules or check out example videos of Mini competitions to learn more!</p>
