                    <h2>Working with GPIO Pins and a PIR Sensor</h2>
                    <h4>Set up the Hardware</h4>
                    <ul><li>Take out the six Male to Female jumper wires, the PIR sensor, and the solderless breadboard from the box and set next to the Pi.</li>
                    <li>Start by connecting the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins to the solderless breadboard:<ul style="margin-bottom:0px">
                    <li>For the first wire, connect the female wire end to Pin 2 (5v DC Power) and the male end to the + column on the far right of the solderless breadboard</li>
                        <li>For the second wire, connect the female wire end to Pin 6 (Ground) and the male end to the - column on the far right of the solderless breadboard (right next to the first wire!)</li>
                        <li>For the third wire, connect the female end to Pin 40 (GPIO 21) and connect the male end to row 30, column j of the breadboard.</li></ul></li>
                        <img src="/images/modules/raspberry_pi_beginner/wiring_to_pi.jpg" width="40%" style="float:right">
                        <li>Now, let’s connect the pins on the PIR sensor to our solderless breadboard<ul>
                        <li>For the first wire, connect the female end of the wire to the pin labeled VCC and the male end of the wire to the + column on the far right of the solderless breadboard (above the wire connected to the Pi’s 5v pin).</li>
                        <li>For the second wire, connect the female end of the wire to the pin labeled GND and the male end of the wire to the - column on the far right of the solderless breadboard (above the wire connected to the Pi’s Ground pin).</li>
                        <li>For the third wire, connect the female end of the wire to the pin labeled OUT and the male end of the wire to row 30, column f (the same row as the wire going to GPIO 21).</li></ul></li></ul>

                    <h4>Set up the Software</h4>
                        <ul><li>We will create a simple python program to display sensor data coming from the PIR sensor!</li>
                        <li>Type nano pir_sensor.py and hit enter.</li>
                        <li>Either copy and paste or type out the following program:</li>
                            {% gist rjulian/f5a961e72b9b493ebf9aeedb5973687f %}
                        <li>When finished, type CTRL+X and Y and then Enter to save the program and exit.</li>
                        <li>To run our program, type python pir_sensor.py and the sensor should react when motion is detected in front of it!</li>
                        <li>Congratulations! You have successfully completed a sensor project with the Raspberry Pi!</li>
                            </ul>
