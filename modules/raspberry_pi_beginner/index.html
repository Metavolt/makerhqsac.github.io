                    </p>

                    <h2>Preparation</h2>
                    <h4>Software</h4>
                    <b>SSH - Secure Shell</b>
                    <p>We communicate with the Raspberry Pi using a software called SSH, which allows commands to be sent over the network to the Raspberry Pi.</p>

                    <p><b>If you use Windows</b>, you need to download and install PuTTY: http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html</p>

                    <p><b>If you use Mac or Linux</b>, congratulations, you have SSH!</p>

                    <h4>Operating System Image</h4>
                    <p>We have to put an operating system on the Raspberry Pi. In this case, we’ll use a massively popular Linux operating system called “Raspbian”.</p>

                    <p>We want to use the Raspbian Lite version found here: https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/ . If you download the non-lite version, no sweat, but your download time will be a little longer.</p>



                    <h2>Raspberry Pi Install and Connection</h2>
                    <h4>Write Operating System Image to SD Card</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Raspberrypi.org has great resources for writing the Raspbian image file to an SD card.
                            <ul style="margin-bottom:0px"><li>For Windows users, https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/windows.md</li>
                                <li>For Mac users, https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/mac.md</li>
                                <li>For Linux users, https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/linux.md</li></ul></li>
                        <li>Insert the MicroSD Card into the Raspberry Pi</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Connect to the Network</h4>
                    <img src="/images/modules/raspberry_pi_beginner/ethernet_connect.jpg" width="300px" style="float:right">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Connect the ethernet cable on one end into the Raspberry Pi and on the other end into the wireless router.</li>
                    <li>Power on the Raspberry Pi by plugging in the micro USB power supply to the wall.</li>
                    <li><b>If you have access to your router firmware</b>, log in and look for something like Client List or “DHCP Client List”, find the <b>IP Address</b> next to the name “raspberrypi”</li>
                    <li><b>If you do not have access to your router firmware</b>, either contact someone who has access to the router admin settings to tell you what the most recent Raspberry Pi host’s <b>IP Address</b> is (tell them it will be listed in the DHCP Client List) OR try doing some host discovery work on the network using the following resources:
                    <ul><li>http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/13936/find-raspberry-pi-address-on-local-network</li>
                    <li>https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ip-address.md</li></ul></li></ul>

                    <h4>Connect to the Pi</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Using the <b>ip address</b> found for the Pi, connect using your ssh client (for Windows, using PuTTY) with <b>pi</b> as the username and <b>raspberry</b> as the password.</li>
                    <li>Once successfully connected, test internet connectivity by typing <b>ping -c 5 8.8.8.8</b> and pressing enter. If the output shows no response or not connected, check your internet connection for the router and restart as needed.</li>
                    <li><b>Congratulations</b>, you’ve successfully connected to the Raspberry Pi 3 headlessly.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h2>Raspberry Pi Wireless Connection</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To begin, it’s good to update the system. Type in sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y upgrade and press Enter. This may take some time, depending on how old the operating system image is.</li>
                    <li>Next, let’s set our wireless country to be the US (rather than the default of UK). type sudo raspi-config and press Enter. This will launch you into a menu, where you navigate with the arrow keys and select with ‘Enter’. Select Internationalisation Options and then Change Wi-fi Country and then scroll to US (or, type u and it’ll take you to the U options) and hit Enter. Now, scroll down and select Finish. When it asks you Would you like to reboot now?, select No.</li>
                    <li>We now need to tell the Pi what wireless network to connect to, so let’s type sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf. At the bottom of the file, type (or copy and paste) in the following, changing out the capitalized words for your actual network name and password
                    <ul><li>network={
                    ssid="YOUR_NETWORK_NAME"
                    psk="YOUR_NETWORK_PASSWORD"
                    }</li></ul></li>
                    <li>Type CTRL+X  and then Y and then Enter to save changes and exit the file.</li>
                    <li>We will now reboot, which will allow the Raspberry Pi to connect to the network again, this time over wireless! This will cause our Raspberry Pi to get a new IP address. We will need to once again find the IP address, just as we did before. Reboot the system by typing sudo reboot (which should quickly log you out of the shell).</li>
                    <li>After a minute or so, attempt to ssh into the pi with its new ip address using the same default username and password from before. If, for whatever reason, a new IP address isn’t appearing or you can’t get in, simply plug the ethernet cable in and you should be able to SSH in using the old IP Address.</li>
                    <li>If successful, Congrats! You have a wirelessly connected Raspberry Pi!</li></ul>

                    <h2>Working with GPIO Pins and a PIR Sensor</h2>
                    <h4>Set up the Hardware</h4>
                    <img src="/images/modules/raspberry_pi_beginner/wiring_to_pi.jpg" width="500px" style="float:right">
                    <ul><li>Take out the six Male to Female jumper wires, the PIR sensor, and the solderless breadboard from the box and set next to the Pi.</li>
                    <li>Start by connecting the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins to the solderless breadboard:<ul style="margin-bottom:0px">
                    <li>For the first wire, connect the female wire end to Pin 2 (5v DC Power) and the male end to the + column on the far right of the solderless breadboard</li>
                        <li>For the second wire, connect the female wire end to Pin 6 (Ground) and the male end to the - column on the far right of the solderless breadboard (right next to the first wire!)</li>
                        <li>For the third wire, connect the female end to Pin 40 (GPIO 21) and connect the male end to row 30, column j of the breadboard.</li></ul></li>
                        <li>Now, let’s connect the pins on the PIR sensor to our solderless breadboard<ul>
                        <li>For the first wire, connect the female end of the wire to the pin labeled VCC and the male end of the wire to the + column on the far right of the solderless breadboard (above the wire connected to the Pi’s 5v pin).</li>
                        <li>For the second wire, connect the female end of the wire to the pin labeled GND and the male end of the wire to the - column on the far right of the solderless breadboard (above the wire connected to the Pi’s Ground pin).</li>
                        <li>For the third wire, connect the female end of the wire to the pin labeled OUT and the male end of the wire to row 30, column f (the same row as the wire going to GPIO 21).</li></ul></li></ul>

                    <h4>Set up the Software</h4>
                        <ul><li>We will create a simple python program to display sensor data coming from the PIR sensor!</li>
                        <li>Type nano pir_sensor.py and hit enter.</li>
                        <li>Either copy and paste or type out the following program:</li>
                        <li>When finished, type CTRL+X and Y and then Enter to save the program and exit.</li>
                        <li>To run our program, type python pir_sensor.py and the sensor should react when motion is detected in front of it!</li>
                        <li>Congratulations! You have successfully completed a sensor project with the Raspberry Pi!</li>
